Software for Exquisite Engines by Caitlin Rowley. 

Exquisite Engine is a software-based system written using Pure Data, intended for use with the Bela Mini nanocomputer (with multichannel expansion) with multiple contact microphones. The patch detects attacks on the active channels to trigger and/or manipulate playback of recordings in real time. The first iteration was created for From the Exquisite Dark (created in collaboration with Josh Spear), where the contact microphones were used to trigger playback to give the illusion that non-sounding objects were producing sounds when interacted with by a percussionist. These interactions included striking, stroking, dropping and switching a power switch on/off, and an option was developed to allow the velocity of the interaction to alter the pitch of the sample played back. Components also exist to allow performers to switch between banks of sounds assigned to the channels in use using either a Trill Bar touch sensor or a MIDI pad controller.
